# üí∞ Building a Business
![banner](pathname:///img/assets/business.png)

You won't find many software makers that don't tinker with a side project in their spare time.
Whether intentional or not, that passion project could make you extra money and at some point, you might start to wonder whether it's time to quit your job and start building out a business.

# ‚ö†Ô∏èCautionary elements

1. Many people start a business with an emotional mindset, whilst remaining positive, it is important that you apply **logical** thought process to decisions related to a new business - emotion has a role, but too much emotion can start your business off on the wrong foot.
2. Many people starting new businesses vastly **overestimate the revenue** that they will earn - they quickly find the promises of business during discussions do not convert into revenue generating activity to the extent that they thought it would. Be prudent with revenue estimation.
3. When starting a new business some people purchase expensive **assets** at the start linked to expected full volume operation.  Do not do this.  Purchase expensive assets gradually, ramp up only once there is revenue being generated to support those assets.
4. Maintain a positive mindset but be **realistic** - there will likely be some setbacks - be **persistent**, but also know when it is time to pack it in.
5. If you are unsure what business to start, consider finding something where the following intersect:
5.1 Something you **enjoy** doing.
5.2 Something you are **good at** - particularly if you are better than the average person.
5.3 Something that is **profitable** for you.
5.4 Something that adds **VALUE** for others (often people have ideas for businesses where the output is not highly and consistently valued).
6. **Don't quit** your day job if you do not have to - this way you have a constant revenue source to see you through as the business builds.
7. **Watch your finances** like a Hawk - do not wait until the end of a month or year to assess - this is your responsibility at high level, not the responsibility of an Accountant.  If you bank balance is moving down or further into overdraft you need to take action to change the trajectory.
