![banner](pathname:///img/assets/taxzebbie.png)

### What is the difference between income tax and capital gains tax?&#x20;

#### Income taxation
Income taxation is taxation levied upon income earned such as remuneration (example: from a job) or revenue (example: consulting fees charged by a consultant).

#### Capital gains taxation
Capital gains tax is tax upon the disposal of a capital asset (example: a secondary property that someone purchased and then sold for a higher value later).
A specific percentage of the capital gain gets included in the income tax of the recipient (i.e. it is deemed taxable income), for Income tax to be levied on the gain.
